	<h2>Factual Internship (Summer 2017)</h2>
	<p>
		After my junior year, I worked at Factual in Los Angeles as a Full Stack developer on the Front Team.
		I primarily worked on a full redesign of the main website's Contact page and associated forms to enable updates directly from the marketing team.
		Before, all changes had to be done by engineers regardless of size or complexity, which was inefficient for everyone involved. 
		I also moved the front-end stack for the forms from Angular V1 to Vue.js.
		Aside from the contact forms, I developed Patchwork, an open source dependency monitoring tool, as part of the company's 6th Annual Hackathon.
