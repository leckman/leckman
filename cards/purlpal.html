  <h2>PurlPal</h2>
  <p>
    PurlPal is a tool to help knitters keep track of their place in patterns.
    Unlike other tools which require the use of a knitter's hands, PurlPal uses
    speech and gesture recognition to automatically and dynamically keep track of progress.
    It was built as the final project for MIT's 6.835 - Multimodal User Interfaces.
