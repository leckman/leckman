  <h2>Lingua</h2>
  <p>
    Lingua is a chat app that connects language learners with native speakers so
    they can better pick up the idiosyncrasies of conversing in that language. It was
    built in a team of 4 as the final project for MIT's 6.170 - Software Studio.
    I primarily handled user account creation and profile page development.
